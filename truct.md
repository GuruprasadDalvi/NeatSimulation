### Evolving Communication in virtual environment
## Purpose:
Purpose of this experiment is to understand if it is possible to evolve communication in ai agents to help them survive in a hostile virtual environment 

Instruments:
    * Dog: a virtual agent capable of walking, listning, barking, eating, reproducing and attacking. Dog will have an artificial neural network of fixed size as brain. input for this brain will be self energy level, current position x and y, sound from adjacent 25 cells, vision from adjacent 25 cells. 
    Inputs to NN:
        1. enetry:  current_enegry/10000
        2. x:       position x
        3. y:       position y
